In this improved version, we use `flock()` to acquire an exclusive lock on the file before accessing and updating the counter. This prevents multiple processes from accessing the file simultaneously. The `LOCK_EX` flag ensures an exclusive lock, and `LOCK_UN` releases the lock after the update.  Error handling is also included to manage potential lock acquisition failures.
```php
<?php
$filename = 'counter.txt';

// Acquire an exclusive lock on the file
if (!flock(fopen($filename, 'c+'), LOCK_EX)) {
    die('Could not lock the file.');
}

// Read the current counter value
$counter = (int)file_get_contents($filename);

// Increment the counter
$counter++;

// Write the updated counter value back to the file
file_put_contents($filename, $counter);

// Release the lock
flock(fopen($filename, 'c+'), LOCK_UN);

echo "Counter updated successfully to: " . $counter;
?>
```
