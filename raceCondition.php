This code suffers from a race condition.  Two processes might try to update the same shared resource (e.g., a file or database record) concurrently, leading to unpredictable and inconsistent results.  Imagine two scripts running simultaneously; they both read the same value from the database, increment it, and then write it back. If both scripts read 10, increment to 11, and then write 11 back, the increment of the other script is lost, resulting in an unexpected final value of 11 instead of 12.
